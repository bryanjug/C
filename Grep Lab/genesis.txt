In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was 
uniform and void, and darkness was upon the face of the earth and the spirit 
of God hovered over the face of the waters. And God said: 'Let there be 
light.' And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and 
God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day, and 
the morning he called night. And there was evening and there was morning 
one day.
